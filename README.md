coindash
========
> Made using the book [Godot 4 Game Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/godot-4-game-development-projects-9781804610404?srsltid=AfmBOorYLKi1u2suNZnnvHmIgqjWj2lENyfsNxAmP7X6HaDl4H2IjfXi), and customized a lot by me after.

I used all the assets from the book, but some audio I created myself using [sfxr](https://sfxr.me/).

The background music is by [Kojv](https://www.looperman.com/users/profile/3210323) and was downloaded for free from [Looperman](https://www.looperman.com/loops/detail/263368/reminds-me-of-ujico-free-161bpm-8bit-chiptune-synth-loop).

How to Play
===========
Press start. Use arrow-keys. Try not to die. Pretty simple, but learned a lot.

I've hosted this on my site here: https://beta.grymmjack.com/godot-coindash/ so you can try it without downloading it, or building it in Godot.
